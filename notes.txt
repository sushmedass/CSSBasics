CSS Box Model
- margin,height,width,padding
- border default 3px
- padding is space between text and element (eg.border)
- margin is space between this element and other elements

CSS Display Property
- inline, block, inline-block, none
- default image elements, same as image, how to change it's height?
- whereas block elements (p,h1,div..etc), takes up whole width of the page
  hence cannot edit a part of the word in these elements.
  Use span instead.
- span, img, a tags are all inline elements, cannot change width.
- but in block elements width can be changed, but cannot style part of it's words.
- Display Property is used in block elements to inline-block

CSS Static and Relative position
- by default elements are positioned statically
- cannot change the position by simply saying left :20px
- have to define position:relative; left: 20px, changes the element position
- it creates a margin Relative to the postion (left,right,up,down)
- Absolute position, elements are pushed to that position
